                        <p>My name is Onke Nyathela, I am currently based in Johannesburg and willing to relocate. I am 26 years old, born and bred in Dutywa, in the Eastern Cape

                            I went to the University Currently known as Rhodes University and studied Computer Sciences. <br><br> Upon my arrival at Rhodes, I had no understanding, nor knowledge of programming. However, the first time I started coding, it was love at first sight and I knew that I did not want to be an Astrophysicist anymore, but a Software Developer

                            It is for this reason that even when I couldn't finish my degree due to financial difficulties, I continued writing code and learning new things on my own, using resources from the internet. <br><br>

                            I have taught myself the basics of Java, JavaScript, and C++. In addition to the C#, C, and F# languages that I learned during my time at university. I am currently learning front-end development.

                            My current portfolio only consists of the front-end of a website and I am hoping for the opportunity to further my front-end skills and practice my back-end skills through this learnership opportunity</p>
